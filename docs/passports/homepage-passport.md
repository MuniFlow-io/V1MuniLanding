# Passport: Homepage - Conversation First

## Page Overview
The **Homepage** is a calm introduction, credibility signal, and conversation starter. This is NOT a sales page, feature list, or product reveal.

**Mental Model**: "The first 5 minutes of a thoughtful conversation with someone who understands the municipal bond deal space."

## Purpose
- Let the right people recognize this is for their world
- Establish credibility through domain understanding
- Start conversations with qualified prospects
- Signal thoughtful, intentional building approach

## Tone & Voice
- **Quiet confidence** - We know this space
- **Professional** - Serious, not playful
- **Specific** - Municipal bond deals, not generic B2B
- **NO hype** - No "revolutionizing" or "disrupting"
- **NO urgency** - No pressure, no FOMO
- **NO volume optimization** - Quality conversations over traffic

## Content Strategy

### Section 1: Hero / Opening Context (Above the Fold)
**Goal**: Let the right people immediately recognize this is for their world.

**Content**:
- One clear statement about municipal bond / deal workflows
- One sentence about reducing friction and manual overhead
- No claims about "revolutionizing" or "disrupting"

**CTA**: 
- "Get in touch" button (primary, only button here)

**Copy Direction** (rough):
```
MuniFlow turns municipal bond deal workflows 
into shared, structured systems.

We reduce friction and manual overhead—
without forcing teams to change how they work.

[Get in Touch]
```

---

### Section 2: What MuniFlow Is Focused On
**Goal**: Explain the problem space without overcommitting.

**Content**:
- Short bullets or paragraphs describing areas of focus:
  - Deal coordination
  - Information flow
  - Workflow visibility
- Framed as areas of focus, NOT finished products

**NO**: Screenshots, feature grids, product demos

**Copy Direction**:
```
We're focused on:

Deal Coordination
How teams move work forward across multiple parties and timelines.

Information Flow
Where critical details live and how they reach the right people.

Workflow Visibility
Seeing what's happening, what's next, and what needs attention.
```

---

### Section 3: Proof of Domain Understanding (Amira-Centered, Subtle)
**Goal**: Establish trust without self-promotion.

**Answers**: "Why should I believe this team understands how these deals actually work?"

**Content**:
- Amira's experience in municipal bond deals
- Types of deals worked on
- Her role in shaping what gets built

**Important**: This is context, NOT a resume dump.

**No buttons needed here.**

**Copy Direction**:
```
Built by someone who's been in the deals.

Amira has worked on [X types of deals], 
seeing firsthand where workflows break down 
and where small changes create real impact.

MuniFlow is built from that experience—
shaped by what actually happens in deal teams.
```

---

### Section 4: How You're Approaching the Build
**Goal**: Signal thoughtful, iterative, grounded building.

**Content**:
- Built directly from real workflows
- Shaped through conversations and demos
- Evolving based on practitioner feedback

**Sets expectation**: "We are building this carefully and intentionally."

**Copy Direction**:
```
How we're building this:

From real workflows
We start with how deals actually run—not abstract processes.

Through conversation
Shaped by ongoing discussions with practitioners.

Iterating intentionally
Evolving based on what works in the field.
```

---

### Section 5: Invitation to Talk
**Goal**: Make it clear that conversation is welcome.

**Content**:
- Open-ended
- Collaborative
- Respectful of time

**CTAs** (main CTA area):
- "Get in touch" (primary)
- "Request a demo" (optional, only if ready to honor it)

**NO**: Signup, waitlist, pricing, create account

**Copy Direction**:
```
Let's talk.

If you're working in municipal bond deals 
and this resonates, we'd like to hear from you.

[Get in Touch]  [Request a Demo]
```

---

## Button Strategy (Critical)

### Buttons We SHOULD Have (v1):
- ✅ "Get in touch"
- ✅ "Contact"
- ✅ "Request a demo" (optional)

### Buttons We Should NOT Build Yet:
- ❌ Sign up
- ❌ Create account
- ❌ Pricing
- ❌ Start trial
- ❌ Learn more (unless it scrolls)
- ❌ Product / Features menus

**Why**: Those buttons imply maturity and scale we're intentionally not claiming yet.

---

## Design Direction

### Visual Approach
- **Clean, spacious layouts** - Generous white space
- **Professional typography** - Readable, serious
- **Minimal decoration** - No flashy animations or effects
- **Subtle depth** - Maybe glass cards on neutral backgrounds, not colorful
- **Calm colors** - Blues, grays, whites - professional, not playful

### Component Usage
- Use **Card** components (solid variant primarily)
- Use **Button** components (primary for CTAs, secondary for optional)
- Keep glass effects minimal or skip them - this isn't the demo page
- Focus on **typography and spacing** over visual effects

---

## Navigation

### Primary Navigation (Top or Sidebar)
**5 Main Pages**:
1. Home
2. Credibility (proof, experience, domain understanding)
3. What We're Building (focus areas, approach)
4. Reach Out (contact, demo request)
5. [5th page TBD]

**Navigation Requirements**:
- Clean spacing between items
- Clear hover states (subtle, not flashy)
- Professional, minimal
- Works on mobile and desktop

---

## What This Homepage Is NOT

- ❌ Not a sales page
- ❌ Not a feature list
- ❌ Not a product reveal
- ❌ Not optimizing for conversions
- ❌ Not creating urgency
- ❌ Not volume-first

## What This Homepage IS

- ✅ A calm introduction
- ✅ A credibility signal
- ✅ A conversation starter
- ✅ For the RIGHT people
- ✅ Conversation-first
- ✅ Credibility-first
- ✅ Quality over volume

---

## Success Metrics

This page succeeds when:
- The right people (muni bond deal practitioners) recognize themselves
- It starts thoughtful conversations
- It establishes credibility through specificity
- It feels professional, calm, and trustworthy
- It does NOT feel like generic SaaS marketing

**NOT measured by**: Traffic, bounce rate, conversion rate, sign-ups

**Measured by**: Quality of conversations started

---

## Current State
**Status**: 🟡 Planning phase

### Next Steps
1. **Navigation component** - Top or sidebar nav with 5 pages
2. **Homepage rough copy** - All 5 sections with placeholder text
3. **Contact component** - Simple, professional contact form
4. **Homepage v1** - Clean, minimal, conversation-first

### Notes
- Hover effects on components may need tuning (noted for future)
- Keep it simple - can ruthlessly refactor later
- Copy first, design second
- Focus on MESSAGE over aesthetics
