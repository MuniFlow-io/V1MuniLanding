# Muniflow Landing Page - Documentation Guide

## Overview
This documentation system provides the foundational context for all future development work on the Muniflow landing page. Every AI and developer working on this project should start here.

## Core Documents

### 📋 [Company Context](./company-context.md)
**Purpose**: Understand what Muniflow does and why this landing page exists.
- Company mission and product
- Current state and market position
- Purpose of this landing page
- Brand philosophy

### 💻 [Development Standards](./development-standards.md)
**Purpose**: Learn how we code and what standards we maintain.
- Tech stack and architecture
- Code quality requirements
- Development workflow
- Best practices and principles

## Passport System

### What is a Passport?
A **passport** is a living document that tracks the state, requirements, and context for a specific aspect of the project (a page, feature, or technical area).

### Why Passports?
We move fast. Passports ensure that speed doesn't come at the cost of losing context. They help:
- Track the current state of features
- Document requirements and goals
- Maintain context across AI sessions
- Guide future development decisions

### Passport Structure
Each passport contains:
1. **Overview**: What this passport covers
2. **Purpose**: Why this exists and what problem it solves
3. **Visual State**: Current state and design goals
4. **Requirements**: Technical/performance/security requirements
5. **Current State**: What's implemented vs. what's planned
6. **Next Steps**: Clear action items

### Current Passports

#### Page Passports
- [Home Page](./passports/home-page-passport.md) - Main entry point

#### Technical Passports
- [Performance & Optimization](./passports/performance-optimization-passport.md) - Speed and optimization standards

#### Future Passports (To Be Created)
- Credibility Page
- What We're Building Page
- Reach Out Page
- Security Passport
- Additional pages as needed

## How to Use This System

### For AIs Starting a New Session
1. Read `company-context.md` to understand the business
2. Read `development-standards.md` to understand how we code
3. Read relevant passports for the features you're working on
4. Update passports when you make significant changes

### For Developers
1. Review core documents before starting work
2. Check passports for the pages/features you're modifying
3. Update passports to reflect new state or decisions
4. Create new passports for new pages or major features

### Creating New Passports
When creating a new passport:
1. Use the existing passport structure as a template
2. Be specific about current state and requirements
3. Include visual descriptions when relevant
4. Document performance and security considerations
5. Add clear next steps
6. Save in `docs/passports/` directory

### Updating Passports
Passports are **living documents**. Update them when:
- Implementation status changes
- Requirements evolve
- Visual design is finalized
- Performance benchmarks are tested
- Security considerations change

Always update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom.

## Principles

### Keep It Clean
Documentation should be as clean as our code. Clear, concise, actionable.

### Move Fast, Track Context
Speed matters, but losing context kills speed long-term. Update as you go.

### Quality Bar
If the app looks great, these docs should be just as polished.

**Remember**: This landing page is a credibility platform. Everything we build - code and documentation - reflects our standards.
